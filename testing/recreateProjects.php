Our solution to this problem can be used for many urban cities where traffic jams during rush hours are becoming a routine affair, especially in the internal sectors where long queues of vehicles can be seen stranded. Therefore, we have tried to address the problem with the help of our project wherein the focus would be to minimise the vehicular congestion. We have achieved this with the help of image processing that can be obtained from surveillance cameras and eventually to deploy a feedback mechanism in the working of the traffic lights where the density of the traffic would also be factored in the decision making process.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: The Objective of our hack is to design a robust and efficient system to solve the traffic jam issues in urban areas.\r\n\r\nPROBLEM with Present System: The present system uses traffic signals which are based on timer ICs to control traffic. Suppose an intersection of four roads in which three roads have varying traffic and one road is empty.

Each part of the target image is then replaced with one from the library where these colors are as similar as possible. In effect, the target image is reduced in resolution (by downsampling), and then each of the resulting pixels is replaced with an image whose average color matches that pixel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the more advanced kind of photographic mosaic, the target image is not downsampled, and the matching is done by comparing each pixel in the rectangle to the corresponding pixel from each library image.

Our solution to this problem can be used for many urban cities where traffic jams during rush hours are becoming a routine affair, especially in the internal sectors where long queues of vehicles can be seen stranded. Therefore, we have tried to address the problem with the help of our project wherein the focus would be to minimise the vehicular congestion. We have achieved this with the help of image processing that can be obtained from surveillance cameras and eventually to deploy a feedback mechanism in the working of the traffic lights where the density of the traffic would also be factored in the decision making process.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: The Objective of our hack is to design a robust and efficient system to solve the traffic jam issues in urban areas.\r\n\r\nPROBLEM with Present System: The present system uses traffic signals which are based on timer ICs to control traffic.

The key insight is that this noise injection prevents the learnt weights from being too delicately balanced to fit the data; some kind of robustness is necessary to fit noisy data.\r\nAnother interesting consequence of noisy data is that recent work shows that learning algorithms using noisy data may be better at protecting privacy of the data. Thus, there may be twin advantages to this approach.

This works because of the how the human eye works.\r\n\r\nThere are two kinds of mosaic, depending on how the matching is done. In the simpler kind, each part of the target image is averaged down to a single color. Each of the library images is also reduced to a single color. Each part of the target image is then replaced with one from the library where these colors are as similar as possible. In effect, the target image is reduced in resolution (by downsampling), and then each of the resulting pixels is replaced with an image whose average color matches that pixel.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the more advanced kind of photographic mosaic, the target image is not downsampled, and the matching is done by comparing each pixel in the rectangle to the corresponding pixel from each library image.

Our solution to this problem can be used for many urban cities where traffic jams during rush hours are becoming a routine affair, especially in the internal sectors where long queues of vehicles can be seen stranded. Therefore, we have tried to address the problem with the help of our project wherein the focus would be to minimise the vehicular congestion. We have achieved this with the help of image processing that can be obtained from surveillance cameras and eventually to deploy a feedback mechanism in the working of the traffic lights where the density of the traffic would also be factored in the decision making process.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: The Objective of our hack is to design a robust and efficient system to solve the traffic jam issues in urban areas.\r\n\r\nPROBLEM with Present System: The present system uses traffic signals which are based on timer ICs to control traffic.

(208, 310, 59, 'Dynamic Hand Gesture Recognition using neural network', 'Hand gesture recognition system is used for interfacing between computer and human using hand gesture. We wish to make a windows-based application for live motion gesture recognition using webcam input in C++. This project is a combination of live motion detection and gesture identification. This application uses the webcam to detect gesture made by the user and perform basic operations accordingly. The user has to perform a particular gesture. The webcam captures this and identifies the gesture, recognizes it (against a set of known gestures) and performs the action corresponding to it. This application can be made to run in the background while the user runs other programs and applications. This is very useful for a hands-free approach. While it may not be of great use for browsing the web or writing a text document, it is useful in media player and while reading documents or files. A simple gesture could pause or play the movie or increase the volume even while sitting afar from the computer screen. One could easily scroll through an eBook or a presentation even while having lunch.\r\n\r\nVarious features of the code of the project are:\r\n\r\nCan detect any kind of gesture which is provided in the database.\r\nEliminates the background so can be operated in a place where there is no much movement in the background\r\nThe movements of the head while performing the gesture are eliminated.', NULL, 0),
(209, 311, 56, 'JamFree', 'Introduction: Traffic Management is an issue which impacts us almost daily. Use of technology and real time analysis can actually lead to a smooth traffic management. The common reason for traffic congestion is due to poor traffic prioritisation.\r\nWhile the number of vehicles are increasing at a fast pace, the infrastructure in the cities are not being able to match this growth. Our solution to this problem can be used for many urban cities where traffic jams during rush hours are becoming a routine affair, especially in the internal sectors where long queues of vehicles can be seen stranded. Therefore, we have tried to address the problem with the help of our project wherein the focus would be to minimise the vehicular congestion. We have achieved this with the help of image processing that can be obtained from surveillance cameras and eventually to deploy a feedback mechanism in the working of the traffic lights where the density of the traffic would also be factored in the decision making process.\r\n\r\nOBJECTIVE: The Objective of our hack is to design a robust and efficient system to solve the traffic jam issues in urban areas.\r\n\r\nPROBLEM with Present System: The present system uses traffic signals which are based on timer ICs to control traffic. Suppose an intersection of four roads in which three roads have varying traffic and one road is empty. The present system will just show a green light for the empty road on its turn for 2-3 mins. and in meantime, the traffic on the other roads will go on increasing and thus lead to traffic jams.\r\nAlso, a lot of fuel is wasted on red lights as people donâ€™t turn off the engine.\r\n\r\nTOOLS USED:\r\nHARDWARE ARCHITECTURE: We shall use Raspberry Pi that is connected to 4 sets of LEDs that represent the traffic lights. The captured images and the reference images are fed to the Raspberry Pi. In real implementation, we will have an automated way to do this via a CCTV camera.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSOFTWARE ARCHITECTURE:\r\nPython\r\nOpenCV (Open Source Computer Vision Library)\r\nThingSpeak Cloud (For data analytics)\r\nData Analytics will also be performed which will help in future traffic planning and analysis.', NULL, 0),
